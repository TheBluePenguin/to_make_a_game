This is something of a cross between a visual novel and a text based adventure. However visuals + sound are only heard at the endings.
For best enjoyment please only type a response when asked a direct question. No other time will a response work.

I made this game as both testiment to my coding abilty/understanding as well as a passion project. 
Id like to turn this into a full fledged game at some point.
Although its not in a perfect state, I hope you enjoy it for what it is.
